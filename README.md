# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
This project involves learning and applying concepts of binary trees as a data structure. This is done in **C programming**  
Binary trees are a fundamental data structure . They're essentially tree-like structures where each node can have at most two children:   
    - a left child and   
    - a right child.   
This organization offers a unique way to store and access data efficiently.

## Key features of binary trees:

### Structure:
    - Each node contains a data element (e.g., a number, a string, an object).  
    - Nodes can be connected to two child nodes.  
    - The topmost node is called the root node.  
    - Nodes without children are called leaf nodes.  
### Order:
Binary trees typically maintain some order among their nodes. Common orderings include:  
    - **Binary search trees (BSTs):**   
Nodes are ordered so that the value in a left child is always less than or equal to the value in its parent, and the value in a right child is always greater than or equal to the value in its parent.  
    - **Heap binary trees:**   
Values in parent nodes are always greater than or equal to their children (max heaps) or less than or equal to their children (min heaps).
### Operations:
You can perform various operations on binary trees, such as:  
    - **Searching:**   
Find a specific element within the tree.
    - **Insertion:**   
Add a new element to the tree while maintaining the ordering.
    - **Deletion:**   
Remove an element from the tree while preserving its structure.
    - **Traversal:**   
Visit each node in the tree in a specific order  
    - Pre-order  
    - In-order  
    - Post-order
